1) For primitive to class typecasting, we need constructor. Without constructor we can't do primitive to class typecasting.

2) For class to primitive type casting, we have casting operator concept

operator type()
{

.....
	return(type-data);
}

3) For class to class typecasting we have 2 ways:-
	i) Conversion through constructor
	-> if we go through this way so we have to make constructor for that class object who is left side of an assignment operator
	e.g i1=p1;
	so we have to make constructor for i1's class

	ii) Conversion through casting operator
	-> if we go through this way so we have to make casting operator for that class object who os right side of an assignment operator
	e.g i1=p1;
	so we have to make constructor for p1's class
